# Software Engineering

## 1. Development Process

### Program vs Software Definition
- **Program**: Programming source code
- **Software**: All outputs generated during development process (programs, data structures, database structures, test results, documents, user manuals)

### Software vs Manufacturing
- **Manufacturing**: Producing products according to fixed patterns
- **Development**: Creating new things or utilizing existing technology to achieve goals
- **Software characteristics**: Functional improvements, new features, adaptation to environmental changes (OS, etc.)

### Software Development Complexity
- **Small vs Large Scale**: Tools, process complexity, team composition, project duration
- **Software engineering**: Applying engineering principles to software development
- **Engineering**: Solving problems using scientific knowledge within limited time and cost
- **SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle

### Software Development Process
A series of activities to implement user requirements into software systems including procedures, methods, tools, and developers.

## 2. Software Development Models

### Build-and-Fix Model
- **Description**: Development without formal guidelines or processes
- **Characteristics**: Simple function organization and development without requirements analysis or design
- **Advantages**: Suitable for single developer, short-term projects
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Lack of documented outputs
  - Difficult maintenance
  - Continuous modification possibilities

### Linear Sequential Model (Waterfall)
- **Description**: Sequential development following standardized processes
- **Characteristics**: Top-down approach, non-parallel, documented results required
- **Procedure**: Planning → Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing → Maintenance
- **Advantages**: Easy management, systematic documentation, suitable for stable requirements
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Each phase must be completed before next
  - Difficult to verify requirements until final stage
  - High cost for modifications

### Evolutionary Process Model
- **Prototype Model**:
  - Creates initial prototype, repeats modification process
  - Suitable for unclear or changing requirements
  - Advantages: Visual results, progressive requirements definition
  - Disadvantages: Difficult cost estimation, prototype vs final product confusion

- **Spiral Model**:
  - Adds risk analysis to prototype model
  - Process: Requirements analysis → Risk analysis → Prototype → User evaluation
  - Advantages: Risk consideration, high user satisfaction
  - Disadvantages: Long development time, requires risk management expertise

### Phased Development Model
- **Incremental Development**: Developing important parts first, gradually expanding scope
- **Iterative Development**: Developing entire system first, then improving each subsystem

### Unified Process Model
- **Description**: Iterative development for large, complex software
- **Phases**: Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition
- **Characteristics**: Flexible response to changing requirements, UML-based

### Agile Process Model
- **Philosophy**: Rapid response to customer needs, solving problems as they arise
- **Agile Values** (2001 Agile Manifesto):
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

### Scrum Framework
- **Components**: Product backlog, Sprint planning, Daily scrum, Sprint review, Sprint retrospective
- **Roles**: Product owner, Scrum master, Development team
- **Artifacts**: Product backlog, Sprint backlog, Burndown chart
- **Advantages**: Regular deliverables, daily coordination, simple methodology
- **Disadvantages**: Requires functional product per sprint, potential meeting overhead
